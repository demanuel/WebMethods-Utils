WebMethods-Utils
================

Some utils for webMethods platform that developers and admins (of the webmethods platform) may find interesting:

* find dependents
When using the findDependents you'll get all the dependents even if they're disabled and not being used. With this
script you can search for the disabled ones or only for the enabled ones. The next step will be to translate this
script to flow (or at least to a java service)
