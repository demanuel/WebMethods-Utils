# To use this program just put this script in a "bin" folder and add to your ~/.bashrc the
# following lines (only one time!):
# for file in /path/to/bin/folder/*.sh
# do
#     . $file
# done 
#
# Then you'll need to logout and then login again. Now everytime you put a script in that "bin"
# folder the script will be fired up when you login. Now you can do: 
# $ findDependents -s pub.log:tracePipeline -l /opt/webmethods7/IntegrationServer
